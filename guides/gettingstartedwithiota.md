Now that you’ve generated and SAVED your seed, you’ll be able to use that seed to login to any IOTA client on any device in the world! Don't ever lose it.


The seed checksum located to the right side of the seed (3 capital letters) will give you quick verification that your seed has been input correctly.

The checksum will be the same every time you enter your correct seed.
